Clara is an orphan—although out the outset, that's the least of the things she doesn't know about herself. What she does know is that she and the only parents she's ever known inexpcliably move to a new city one every year or so—and it's been getting more frequent. She's hoping Las Vegas will be their last stop for a while. She's already contending with a new school, new teachers, and new classmates, not all of whom are great people.

But then things get weird. Three of her classmates—triplets, in fact—seem to vanish in the Las Vegas Art Alley on the way home from school. Clara follows, and discovers that one of the grafitti murals isn't what it seems... and she steps through into the ancient, mythical land of the Fae: Underhill.

Things get a lot stranger, really fast.
