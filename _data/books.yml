    - text: ...Jones has created something new, compelling, beautifully written, and 
            somewhat reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea (1968)...An 
            engrossing, well-written, and original story; readers will be eager for the 
            next installment.

  quotes:
    - text: There's an almost seamless interweaving of elements from English folklore, 
            children's literature, and history. Jones's ideas about the power of creativity 
            and the relationship between the Fae and inspiration work well; the horrendously 
            stereotypical Indians, for example, are explained as Fae manifestations of 
            childish interpretations of faraway stories. ...readers interested in mythology 
            will find much to enjoy in this elegiac tale about attempting to protect one's 
            way of life amid change and destruction.

  content_1: "<strong>Fantasy</strong> · When the ancient Under Hill home of the Fae is infected with the Rot, 
             they're left with an unpleasant choice: die in one last, great stand, or escape 
             to the Human world. A world they once knew, but where they no longer belong. 
             A modern world, where Cold Iron surrounds and poisons magical beings. The Fae 
             Queen reluctantly chooses exile, and she and her people abandon their magical 
             castles, ancient glens, timeless forests, and centuries of power and tradition. 
             They come into a bleak land bereft of magic and wonder, and begin to hunker down 
             in the Human world's hidden places. The once-proud Fae resentfully begin a life 
             of poverty, anonymity, and fear. But one small group of Fae, accustomed to 
             tinkering with the fabric of the universe, begin to develop an idea. An idea 
             that will either give them a new world to live in, or wipe them completely from 
             existence. An idea that could preserve them, or end them forever. An idea that 
             requires the help of a young child's boundless imagination. An idea that will 
             take them into the Never, a place forbidden and inimical to their kind. It's a 
             story that you think you know, but you've only ever heard a small part of it. 
             A story that starts long before those three children flew in, and that has its 
             epic conclusion long after they've gone."
  content_2: <strong>"This thoughtful reinterpretation of Peter Pan through myth and folklore
             will appeal to fans of darker adult takes on children's literature." —BookLife</strong>
