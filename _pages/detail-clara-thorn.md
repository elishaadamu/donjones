        Clara Thorn: The Witch that was Found is an incredibly well written Young Adult Fantasy - using magical realism to bring the enchanting world of Underhill to life. The lore of the world he has created is easy to understand, as he reveals it in dribs and drabs, allowing the reader to learn about this new realm at the same speed as Clara, the protagonist. He has hit on all of the typical tropes including found family and magic schools, while managing to create something completely and utterly unique.

        Jones links math and magic in a way that makes math seem cool, and fans of Harry Potter will enjoy some familiar story beats, right down to a magical version of an athletic competition. Fresh ideas, some welcome diversity, and memorable character work enliven the material...

        [Clara's] synesthesialike power showcases the author’s radiant prose: “Clara realized that the room—the very air—was filled with glowing equations—not the usual soft reds, blues, and greens she was used to seeing, but angry, bright primary colors muddied with brown and black.”

Clara is an orphan—although out the outset, that's the least of the things she doesn't know about herself. What she does know is that she and the only parents she's ever known inexpcliably move to a new city one every year or so—and it's been getting more frequent. She's hoping Las Vegas will be their last stop for a while. She's already contending with a new school, new teachers, and new classmates, not all of whom are great people.

But then things get weird. Three of her classmates—triplets, in fact—seem to vanish in the Las Vegas Art Alley on the way home from school. Clara follows, and discovers that one of the grafitti murals isn't what it seems... and she steps through into the ancient, mythical land of the Fae: Underhill.

Things get a lot stranger, really fast.
