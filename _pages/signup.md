Here's where you'll find all my freebies—just click through the various sections below to see each one. There's no commitment—you'll find direct download links. Short stories are provided in PDF format, while full novels are usually in both PDF and EPUB.

However, before you go on, I'd like to invite you to join my author mailing list. I never rent, share, or sell your information, and I use this only to announce new releases. Newsletter subscribers have the opportunity to get free pre-release copies of new novels, with the agreement that you'll leave an honest review on Amazon, Goodreads, or elsehwere once the book launches. That is a huge and valuable service for an indie author like me, and I appreciate you considering it. Obviously, you can unsubscribe anytime you want to by clicking the easy link included in each email.

You can also get notifications directly from Amazon, Bookbub, and Goodreads, although I can't offer pre-release access via those.
