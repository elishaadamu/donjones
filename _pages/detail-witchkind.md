        ...Jones has created something new, compelling, beautifully written, and somewhat reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin’s A Wizard of Earthsea (1968)...An engrossing, well-written, and original story; readers will be eager for the next installment."

        "Adult and teenage fans of thoughtful fantasy will love exploring this beautifully described world of arcane powers. This meditative look at power will engage readers who like their fantasy with a side of philosophy. Great for fans of Ursula K. Le Guin’s A Wizard of Earthsea, Neil Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book."

Imagine a world similar to our own centuries ago. A world where magic exists—but whose practitioners, those of witchkind, live in secret alongside ordinary humans. A world where five of the six great magical energies—Sea, Sky, Flame, Earth, and Endings—have been bound into five Axes, consolidating their power into their Chosen Adherents.

Daniel Scratch is an orphan of witchkind, sent on this thirteenth birthday to be Tested. Like a select few before him, he is Chosen—destined to become the lone adherent of the Sixth Axis of Endings... and Death.

His awesome new powers may be the only thing that can stop a growing plot that threatens humanity, the Veil that hides magic and keeps it safe, and all of witchkind.
