I'd love to hear from you. However, if you're selling something, I'm good, please don't bother. But if you're reading, or have read, one of my books, I'd truly love to hear from you, and I promise to reply.

It's real easy. Take a look at any of my books and you'll see my first name, right there on the cover. It's three letters long. Take that, add an "@" sign, and then finish with the domain name of this very website (it's in the upper-left corner). That's my email address!

My email address is definitely not [spam@blackhole.org](mailto:spam@blackhole.org). Definitely not.
