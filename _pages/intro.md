Hi! I'm Don. I love telling stories. Love it! World building, fun dialog, creative plots, you name it, I'm here for it. After a career of writing about computer stuff (60-odd books), business and career management (slightly fewer books), and running tech startups, nothing relaxes me more than sinking into a good story—whether I'm reading it or writing it. I hope you'll enjoy the stories I've written—be sure to scroll down, where you'll find a button that'll get you **FIVE!** free, full-length novels and a bunch of short stories.

Most of my books are currently self-published, but let me assure you: I spend the time and resources to do it right. Every novel goes through a first-stage developmental edit, line editing, and multiple copy editors. I want the stories to shine for you—and I'm certain they will!

All of my novels are available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle format (and some in hardcover and audiobook); you can also get paperbacks from almost any bookseller. All but a few of my newest releases are also available from Apple, Kobo, and other ebook retailers. Just click "Series Details" for links!
